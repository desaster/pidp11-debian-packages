.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the

This manual page was written for the Debian distribution

Instead, it has documentation in various text files;  see below.

Note that the copyright situation for the VAX "bios" is unclear.
So, the ka655.bin file is not included in this Debian package.
